# OrphanConnect

OrphanConnect is a mobile application I’m currently developing as part of my academic project. The app is designed to serve as a simple, reliable platform for discovering orphanages and supporting them through donations — similar in concept to Bolt Food, but focused on giving rather than ordering.

### Key Features:
- Browse a list of verified orphanages
- View orphanage profiles with detailed information
- Make secure donations directly through the app
- Track your donation history and engagement

This project is built with **React Native** and uses **Firebase** for authentication and data management. I'm working to ensure the app is both user-friendly and impactful, with the goal of making it easier for individuals to connect with and support vulnerable children across Ghana.

Feedback, suggestions, or collaboration opportunities are always welcome. Thank you for visiting the repository.
